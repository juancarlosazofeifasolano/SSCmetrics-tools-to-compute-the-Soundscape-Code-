#SSCmetrics: A MATLAB tool to compute the 'Soundscape Code'

This repository accompanies our paper Soundscape analysis reveals fine ecological differences among coral reef habitats (Azofeifa-Solano et al. 2025).

The goal of this MATLAB tool is to show and explain all the necessary processing steps and MATLAB commands to compute the five metrics of the Soundscape Code (Wilford et al. 2021). The project provides an example audio data from a SoundTrap ST600 (Ocean Instruments, New Zealand) deployed in Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The example WAV file is a five minute recording, using high gain, and 48 kHz sampling rate. The audio file is calibrated and processed into four one-minute segments, following the one-minute length files in Wilford et al. (2021). Thus, this code computes and stores the Soundscape Code metrics for each one-minute segment.
Consider that this code is meant to show how the code works on a single example, specific to our instrument, and in the MATLAB Online environment. For batch processing and other instruments, the code should be modified to consider local directories, noise removal, instrument-specific calibration, and loops for batch processing. 
In the MATLAB live file, we provide the code with a brief exaplanation, following the equations in Wilford et al. (2021) and updates of terminology in ISO (2017).
